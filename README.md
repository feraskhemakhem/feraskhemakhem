<!-- - My GitHub is only a starting place! Most of my games are not here, but you can find my best games on [itch.io](itch.io/dashboard) -->

Here are some of my highlight projects ✨:

- [MatchMaker Bot](https://github.com/feraskhemakhem/MatchMaker)<br>
  A discord bot designed to create and balance teams playing in custom Valorant lobbies, written mostly in JavaScript with Discord.js. Documentation provides integration steps.

- [Project Brender](https://github.com/sueda/brender) <br>
  A file converting and exporting extension of Blender, written in C++ and Python. Brender supports unique file formats like arrays of objects, which some animators have an easier time exporting from other softwares than other formats. Also forked by the Blender Foundation.

- [X-ray COVID Classifier](https://github.com/jeff-hykin/x-flow-team)<br>
  A classifier that determines if a user has COVID based on chest X-rays, developed in Python and trained using Machine Learning. This is a group project, but I specifically worked on pre-processing images and implementing multiple feature selection method to create the best feature set.

Some projects currently in the works to keep an eye out for 🔨:
- [Yue](https://github.com/feraskhemakhem/Yue)<br>
  The beginnings of my own game engine, which will include a renderer with DirectX and Vulkan implementation, an event system, input polling, and so much more to come.

- [Cubed](https://github.com/feraskhemakhem/Cubed)<br>
  A sandbox 3D game made in C++ and Vulkan. It's mostly a fun experiment to learn Vulkan, implement Steam networking, and integrate open source libraries like [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) and [Walnut](https://github.com/StudioCherno/Walnut).
