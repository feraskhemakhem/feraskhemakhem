Here are some of my highlight projects ✨:

- [MatchMaker Bot](https://github.com/feraskhemakhem/MatchMaker)<br>
  A discord bot designed to create and balance teams playing in custom Valorant lobbies, written mostly in JavaScript with Discord.js.

- [Project Brender](https://github.com/sueda/brender) <br>
  A file converting and exporting extension of Blender, written in C++ and Python. Brender supports unique file formats like arrays of objects, which some animators have an easier time exporting from other softwares than other formats. Also forked by the Blender Foundation.

- [X-ray COVID Classifier](https://github.com/jeff-hykin/x-flow-team)<br>
  A classifier that determines if a user has COVID based on chest X-rays, developed in Python and trained using Machine Learning. This is a group project, but I specifically worked on pre-processing images and implementing multiple feature selection method to create the best feature set.
