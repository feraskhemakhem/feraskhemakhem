Welcome to my GitHub! Listed are some of my highlight projects âœ¨:

- [MatchMaker Bot](https://github.com/feraskhemakhem/MatchMaker) is a discord bot designed to create and balance teams playing in custom lobbies. The reason I made this software was to make my experience in 10-man Valorant servers smoother, creating teams in a non-biased way with variety in case players wish to mix-up teams. The software registers users' competitive ranks upon joining a server. When players want to create a custom lobby, the bot collects the players and creates pseudo-random balanced teams for the lobby. Current functionality is compatible with Valorant, with League of Legends and Overwatch 2 as in plans for future incorporation. This is unique to Valorant's auto-balance feature for custom lobbies as MatchMaker supports less players and can create a variety of balanced teams (as opposed to just the most optimal team). In addition, MatchMaker indiciates which team has an advantage, making it more fair when picking map/side.
